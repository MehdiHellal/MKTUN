              <p class="mb-0">The most popular traditional male costume is the Jebba. It is still worn by some men. The Jebba is made of silk and wool. It covers almost the whole body as the only parts that will be showing are the forearms and the calves. The Jebba can be worn with a Farmla which is a vest. Sometimes you will see a Sadra or Badia as well. The outfit is finished off with a jacket that is called a Montane and some baggy trousers or Sirouel. A silk sash is used as a sort of belt right at the waist. There are many different colors when it comes to the Jebba and t is considered a ceremonial garment. You will also see the traditional round felt hat called the Chechia.</p>

              <p class="mb-0">A kaftan  is a variant of the robe or tunic and has been worn by several cultures around the world for thousands of years. The kaftan is often worn as a coat or overdress, usually reaching to the ankles, and with long sleeves. It can be made of wool, cashmere, silk, or cotton, and may be worn with a sash.<br>
                The Sefsari is a large scarf that is made from yellow or white silk. It covers the entire body of the Tunisian woman. The Sefsari is still worn in some out of town areas by the older women but most young women do not wear it.<br>
                  In rural areas, women still wear brightly colored dresses, often in the Berber style and made of blue or red cotton, some are called Takhlila and representing their region or their village. The fabric is opened on the side and is held at the waist with a belt and at the shoulders by two clasps.

            <div class="bg-faded p-5 rounded">
              <p class="mb-0">The Tunisian Burnous, which is a long cloak of coarse woollen fabric with a hood, is frequently worn, especially in the south and the north-west of the country where winter nights can be very rough. Thereâ€™s also the Kachabia, a kind of wool coat that became very appreciated not only by adults, but also by young adults and teenagers since it is modish and efficient at the same time.<br>
              A flat-surfaced, traditional red woolen hat, known as the chechia, is a fairly common sight on the streets of the old city of Tunis. The national hat has become a Tunisian trademark, among the symbols of the country's rich heritage. However, today the cap is often considered old-fashioned and the demand for it is decreasing across the country. Some fear that in a few years, the chechia will be nothing but a fading memory.
